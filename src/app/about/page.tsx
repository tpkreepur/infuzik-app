              Infuzik was started by Binaural Beats enthusiasts with close to 10
              years experiencing the benefits of Binaural Beats. Over the years
              we have tried beats from several different providers. Not finding
              exactly what we wanted we decided to develop our own. Once we
              succeeded, we realized that others could benefit from our
              customized beats and thus Infuzik was born.

              We offer Binaural Beats with customized settings that are intended
              to be used by themselves when no distractions are desired, also
              offering a service to combine beats with the music of your choice.
              This allows you to listen to what you want and experience the
              benefits of Binaural Beats at the same time. What you want to
              listen to doesnâ€™t even have to be music. Some like to prepare for
              sleep listening to white noise, calming sounds or even ASMR.
              Combining that with Delta waves for sleep provides a powerful
              improvement to your sleep regimen. Combining Alpha waves with your
              favorite playlist can supercharge your workout. Guided meditation
              combined with Theta waves will get you in the zone and help you
              stay there. Waking up to Alpha waves while you get ready for work
              can be your digital cup of coffee.

              Our products We offer subscription-based access to customized
              Binaural Beats with unique settings that can be used beyond
              meditation and sleep settings (we offer meditation and sleep beats
              too). The focus categories of beats we offer are intended to be
              used during activities such as exercise and work. When combined
              with bone conduction headsets (that we also offer) experiencing
              the benefits of extra focus during work hours becomes convenient.
              Our beats for work do not have an ambient music overlay as is
              generally found from YouTube or App offerings from others. This
              removes distraction while still providing the focus benefits.
