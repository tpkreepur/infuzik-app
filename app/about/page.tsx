        <p className="text-lg">
          Infuzik was started by Binaural Beats enthusiasts with close to 10
          years experiencing the benefits of Binaural Beats. Over the years we
          have tried beats from several different providers. Not finding exactly
          what we wanted we decided to develop our own. Once we succeeded, we
          realized that others could benefit from our customized beats and thus
          Infuzik was born.

        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4 text-right">What we do</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          We offer Binaural Beats with customized settings that are intended to
          be used by themselves when no distractions are desired, also offering
          a service to combine beats with the music of your choice. This allows
          you to listen to what you want and experience the benefits of Binaural
          Beats at the same time. What you want to listen to doesnâ€™t even have
          to be music. Some like to prepare for sleep listening to white noise,
          calming sounds or even ASMR. Combining that with Delta waves for sleep
          provides a powerful improvement to your sleep regimen. Combining Alpha
          waves with your favorite playlist can supercharge your workout. Guided
          meditation combined with Theta waves will get you in the zone and help
          you stay there. Waking up to Alpha waves while you get ready for work
          can be your digital cup of coffee.

        <p className="text-lg">
          Our products We offer subscription-based access to customized Binaural
          Beats with unique settings that can be used beyond meditation and
          sleep settings (we offer meditation and sleep beats too). The focus
          categories of beats we offer are intended to be used during activities
          such as exercise and work. When combined with bone conduction headsets
          (that we also offer) experiencing the benefits of extra focus during
          work hours becomes convenient. Our beats for work do not have an
          ambient music overlay as is generally found from YouTube or App
          offerings from others. This removes distraction while still providing
          the focus benefits.
