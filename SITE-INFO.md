Entrain your brain with Infuzik

## ABOUT US

## Who we are

Infuzik was started by Binaural Beats enthusiasts with close to 10 years experiencing
the benefits of Binaural Beats. Over the years we have tried beats from several
different providers. Not finding exactly what we wanted we decided to develop our own.
Once we succeeded, we realized that others could benefit from our customized beats
and thus Infuzik was born.

## What we do

We offer Binaural Beats with customized settings that are intended to be used by
themselves when no distractions are desired, also offering a service to combine beats
with the music of your choice. This allows you to listen to what you want and
experience the benefits of Binaural Beats at the same time. What you want to listen to
doesn’t even have to be music. Some like to prepare for sleep listening to white noise,
calming sounds or even ASMR. Combining that with Delta waves for sleep provides a
powerful improvement to your sleep regimen. Combining Alpha waves with your
favorite playlist can supercharge your workout. Guided meditation combined with Theta
waves will get you in the zone and help you stay there. Waking up to Alpha waves
while you get ready for work can be your digital cup of coffee.

## Our products

We offer subscription-based access to customized Binaural Beats with unique settings
that can be used beyond meditation and sleep settings (we offer meditation and sleep
beats too). The focus categories of beats we offer are intended to be used during
activities such as exercise and work. When combined with bone conduction headsets
(that we also offer) experiencing the benefits of extra focus during work hours becomes
convenient. Our beats for work do not have an ambient music overlay as is generally
found from YouTube or App offerings from others. This removes distraction while still
providing the focus benefits.

## Additional information on Binaural Beats

Whether you seek the sharp clarity of Beta waves or the serene depths of Delta waves,
our auditory stimuli are crafted to guide your brain into these states with precision and
care. The interface may seem simple, yet it holds a spectrum of modulations—binaural
beats, a doorway to advanced brainwave entrainment.

As you delve into this experience, you will find not just sound, but guidance—a
walkthrough of the principles and benefits of brainwave entrainment. We invite you to
scroll down and explore how these sound patterns can enhance your well-being.
Welcome to a journey of tuning into your brain’s natural frequencies, a step towards
understanding and harnessing the real, scientifically grounded patterns of brainwaves.
Through auditory entrainment, you can synchronize your brain&#39;s rhythms, achieving
states of focus or relaxation with ease. From the tranquil 4Hz Delta waves to the
focused 30Hz Beta waves, select your desired frequency via the icons.
Embark on this exploration, and let the sound guide you to new realms of mental clarity
and peace.

## Safe and Subtle: What to Expect from Brainwave Entrainment

Using our online audio tool doesn’t require expertise. Here&#39;s how it works:

- Hover over the icons and select the mode you want your brain to be in Deep
  Sleep, Dreaming, Creativity, Relaxation\Meditation, Productivity, Focus
- Wear your headphones. Binaural beats work by sending a different frequency to
  each ear. Your brain interprets the beats and goes to the frequency in between
  what each ear hears (10Hz to the left ear and 12Hz to the right ear sends the
  brain to 11Hz). Binaural Beats don’t work with speakers, and it sounds odd.
- Click on the icon of your choice. Within a couple minutes you should start to feel
  the effects.
- With all the icons you should feel a sense of calm clarity and a marked decrease
  in internal mental “chatter”.
  Embark on this exploration with Infuzik®, and let the sound guide you to new realms of
  mental clarity and peace.
